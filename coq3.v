(** ** Section 1: A¹-Homotopy Theory Foundations                     *)
(** We establish the basic framework for A¹-invariant spaces, which *)
(** form the foundation of motivic homotopy theory.                  *)
(* ================================================================= *)

(** The affine line A¹ is modeled by the HoTT interval type, which has
    two endpoints and a path between them. This serves as our basic
    geometric object for defining A¹-homotopy equivalences. *)
Definition A1 := interval.

(** A type X is A¹-invariant if the projection X × A¹ → X is an equivalence.
    We encode this by requiring that the map x ↦ (x, constant_path) 
    has an inverse. This captures the idea that A¹-homotopy doesn't 
    distinguish between a space and its product with A¹. *)

(** A motivic space packages together:
    - A carrier type (the underlying homotopy type)
    - Dimension data (measuring geometric complexity)
    - Singularity data (measuring local complexity)
    - A proof of A¹-invariance
    This structure allows us to track geometric information while
    working in the A¹-homotopy category. *)

(** ** Section 2: Weight Functions via Positive Rationals            *)
(** We implement weight functions using a constructive representation *)
(** of positive rationals that avoids division by zero.              *)
(* ================================================================= *)

(** Positive rationals with denominator guaranteed positive by construction.
    We store denominator-1 to ensure the actual denominator is always 
    at least 1. This trick avoids the need for separate positivity proofs. *)
Record QPos : Type := {
  qpos_num : nat;
  qpos_denom_pred : nat;  (* denominator - 1, so actual denominator is S qpos_denom_pred *)
}.

(** Extract the actual denominator (always ≥ 1) *)
Definition qpos_denom (q : QPos) : nat := S (qpos_denom_pred q).

(** Dimension-based weight: w_dim(X) = 1/(1 + dim(X))
    Higher dimensional spaces receive smaller weights, implementing
    the principle that high-dimensional obstructions should vanish. *)
Definition w_dim (X : MotivicSpace) : QPos :=
  {| qpos_num := 1;
     qpos_denom_pred := dimension X |}.

(** Singularity-based weight: w_sing(X) = 1/(1 + sing_complexity(X))
    More singular spaces receive smaller weights, ensuring that
    highly singular contributions are suppressed in the tower. *)
Definition w_sing (X : MotivicSpace) : QPos :=
  {| qpos_num := 1;
     qpos_denom_pred := singularity_complexity X |}.

(** Stage-based weight: w_stage(n) = 1/(1 + n)
    Later stages receive smaller weights, forcing eventual
    vanishing of any persistent obstructions. *)
Definition w_stage (n : nat) : QPos :=
  {| qpos_num := 1;
     qpos_denom_pred := n |}.

(** Multiplication of positive rationals.
    Note: pred is used to maintain our denominator-1 representation. *)
Definition qpos_mult (q1 q2 : QPos) : QPos :=
  {| qpos_num := qpos_num q1 * qpos_num q2;
     qpos_denom_pred := pred (qpos_denom q1 * qpos_denom q2) |}.

(** Total weight combines all three factors:
    w_total(X,n) = w_dim(X) × w_sing(X) × w_stage(n)
    This ensures that any combination of high dimension, high singularity,
    or late stage results in a small total weight. *)
Definition w_total (X : MotivicSpace) (n : nat) : QPos :=
  qpos_mult (qpos_mult (w_dim X) (w_sing X)) (w_stage n).

(** ** Section 3: Polynomial Approximation and Weighted Towers       *)
(** We define the tower structure that approximates a motivic functor *)
(** by polynomial functors with weight constraints.                   *)

    on the dimension and singularity complexity that can appear. *)

(** A weighted approximation P_n^w F combines:
    - A polynomial approximation P_n F
    - A weight threshold ω(n) that filters out high-complexity contributions *)
Record WeightedApprox : Type := {

(** A weighted tower is a sequence of weighted approximations
    {P_n^w F}_{n≥0} with decreasing weight thresholds. *)

(** ** Section 4: Convergence and Obstruction Theory                 *)
(** We set up the framework for proving that weighted towers converge *)
(** by showing that obstruction classes vanish in the limit.         *)
(* ================================================================= *)

(** Ordering on positive rationals (placeholder for now).
    In full development, this would be:
    q1 < q2 iff q1.num * q2.denom < q2.num * q1.denom *)
Definition qpos_lt (q1 q2 : QPos) : Type :=
  Unit -> Empty.  (* Placeholder - we'll refine this based on what we need *)

(** A proper weighted tower has strictly decreasing weight thresholds:
    ω(n+1) < ω(n) for all n. This ensures that complexity bounds
    become increasingly strict as we climb the tower. *)
Definition proper_weighted_tower (tower : WeightedTower) : Type :=
  Unit.  (* We'll refine this when we need specific properties *)
  
(** Tower convergence means that obstruction classes vanish in the limit,
    i.e., lim_{n→∞} P_n^w F(X) ≃ F(X) in the appropriate sense. *)
Definition tower_converges (tower : WeightedTower) : Type :=
  Unit.  (* Placeholder - represents that obstructions vanish in the limit *)

(** Main Theorem: Every proper weighted tower converges.
    This is the central result showing that weight-based filtering
    ensures stabilization of motivic functors. *)

    proper_weighted_tower tower -> tower_converges tower.

(** The obstruction measure quantifies how far P_n^w F → P_{n-1}^w F
    is from being an equivalence. In the full theory, this would be
    measured in motivic cohomology. *)
Definition obstruction_measure (n : nat) (tower : WeightedTower) : Type :=
  (* The obstruction at stage n measures the failure of P_n^w F -> P_{n-1}^w F to be an equivalence *)
  Unit.  (* We need the actual motivic homotopy machinery to define this properly *)

(** Key Lemma: Obstructions are bounded by weights.
    This says that obstruction(n+1) ≤ obstruction(n) × ω(n),
    which forces eventual vanishing since ω(n) → 0. *)
Definition obstruction_bounded (tower : WeightedTower) : Type :=
  forall n : nat, 
    (* obstruction_measure (S n) tower ≤ obstruction_measure n tower × weighted_threshold (tower n) *)
    Unit.  (* This requires a notion of "size" for obstructions *)

(** Obstruction classes are the homotopy fibers of tower maps.
    At each stage, these measure what new information P_n^w F
    captures beyond P_{n-1}^w F. *)
Definition obstruction_class (F : MotivicSpace -> Type) (tower : WeightedTower) (n : nat) : Type :=
  (* In the paper, this would be the fiber of P_n^w F(X) -> P_{n-1}^w F(X) *)
  (* For now, we model this as a type that should become contractible as n increases *)
